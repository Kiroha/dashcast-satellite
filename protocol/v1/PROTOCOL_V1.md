# DashCast satellite protocol v1

Status: experimental receiver and guidance companion APKs are available. Vehicle rendering,
AndroidKeyStore TLS handshakes and WebView codec performance still need device testing.
The receiver is disabled by default. This is a local protocol with no cloud relay or discovery.

## Pairing and transport

Open Settings → Satellite device → Pair a device. The optional six-digit-code exchange in
`PAIRING_V1.md` transfers this profile without a file; manual JSON import remains available:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hosts": ["192.168.43.1"],
  "port": 47832,
  "path": "/satellite/v1",
  "certificateSha256": "<64 lowercase hex characters>",
  "token": "<installation-local 256-bit secret, base64url without padding>"
}
```

Choose the reachable LAN host and connect to `wss://HOST:47832/satellite/v1`. IPv6 hosts need
brackets. Pin the SHA-256 of the **DER certificate**, not SPKI, before sending the token. The
self-signed certificate identifies this installation: a generic trust-all TLS client is not an
acceptable implementation. Keep the token in AndroidKeyStore-backed storage; do not put it in URLs,
logs, analytics, screenshots or bug reports. Revocation rotates the token and closes existing
connections. Reinstallation changes the identity. Pairing is intentionally excluded from backup.

Use a persistent connection with TCP_NODELAY. Bind the companion connection to the local network
when its SIM supplies internet; do not change the default network for Maps/ABRP. Only loopback,
private/link-local IPv4 and private/link-local IPv6 peers are accepted. There is one authenticated
sender, up to two pending handshakes, a five-second authentication deadline, a 64 KiB UTF-8 message
limit, a 100-message/second control limit and bounded signalling output. Binary messages are refused.

First message:

```json
{"type":"hello","version":1,"token":"<paired token>"}
```

Satellite may add optional display metadata to `hello`:

```json
{"type":"hello","version":1,"token":"<paired token>","device":{"id":"12345678-1234-4123-8123-123456789abc","name":"Carlinkit Tbox Ultra"}}
```

`device.id` is a canonical lowercase random UUID v4 generated once per Satellite installation and
stored outside Android backup, never a hardware identifier. `device.name` is the sender-reported
manufacturer/model label: 1–80 UTF-16 code units, at most 160 UTF-8 bytes, trimmed and nonblank,
without control characters, Unicode format characters or surrogate code units. Whitespace within
the label is limited to ordinary spaces, so labels cannot insert additional UI lines.
Absent or malformed metadata is ignored; the connection remains compatible with the original v1
hello and is shown as an unknown device. Receivers without this extension ignore `device`.

Accept and record this metadata only after token authentication. It is a display aid, not a unique
device credential: copies of the same profile share one token and can report the same name or ID.
The receiver distinguishes the current authenticated connection from its last authenticated
connection, records the numeric peer address only as a network location, and clears that history
when credentials are revoked. Sending a pairing profile does not itself establish a connected or
authenticated device. No device names or IDs are added to support logs.

Both applications display a common **DashCast ID**: the first 16 uppercase hexadecimal characters
of `certificateSha256`, grouped as `ABCD-EF01-2345-6789`. This is a visual installation label;
certificate verification always uses the complete 64-character fingerprint. Satellite distinguishes
its saved receiver profile from a connection accepted by that receiver. Token revocation preserves
the receiver certificate ID, while reinstalling DashCast changes it.

Reply:

```json
{"type":"welcome","version":1,"session":"<opaque id>","navigationTimeoutMs":6000,"remoteGuidance":false,"videoTransport":"webrtc"}
```

A busy receiver refuses another sender. Reconnect with backoff and a new WebSocket after failure.
Version mismatch is refused. Unknown message types produce an error; unknown fields are ignored.
Control heartbeat: `{"type":"ping"}` → `{"type":"pong"}`. Pings do **not** keep guidance alive.

## Guidance

The user must explicitly select **Use satellite guidance**. Existing HUD/cluster destination
switches still apply, as do existing platform gates. Local navigation is selected otherwise,
including when the receiver is disabled. Video does not change guidance source selection.

```json
{
  "type":"navigation.update",
  "seq":1,
  "ageMs":0,
  "maneuver":"right",
  "distanceMeters":200,
  "roadName":"Example road",
  "remainingDistanceMeters":2000,
  "remainingTimeSeconds":300,
  "etaHour":14,
  "etaMinute":30
}
```

Required fields: `type`, `seq`, `ageMs`, `maneuver`, `distanceMeters`.

* `seq`: strictly increasing nonnegative signed 64-bit integer for this WebSocket, across updates
  and stop messages. Duplicates cannot refresh liveness. Start over only on a new connection.
* `ageMs`: age of the source observation, 0–1500 ms. Preserve source age through queues. Sending an
  old cached observation with a new sequence and age zero is incorrect.
* `maneuver`: `left`, `right`, `slight_left`, `slight_right`, `sharp_left`, `sharp_right`, `uturn_left`,
  `uturn_right`, `straight`, `destination`, `roundabout_cw`, `roundabout_ccw`. The last two require
  integer `exit` 1–10. Directions mean circulation direction; the receiver maps portable values to
  its existing OEM codes. Never send CAN/SendInfo2 icon numbers.
* `distanceMeters`: integer 0–1,000,000. Optional remaining distance: 0–10,000,000 m; remaining time:
  0–604,800 s. Numeric strings, fractions and booleans are rejected.
* `roadName`: optional string, at most 160 UTF-16 units, no control characters.
* ETA: optional hour 0–23 and minute 0–59, supplied together; null/absent means unknown.

Publish on changes and refresh a genuinely observed active guidance snapshot at least every two
seconds. If the source is unavailable or the maneuver cannot be recognized, do not invent a turn.
The receiver clears after six seconds including source age, and on disconnect/source change. A
queued snapshot must still meet the 1500 ms source-age budget when dispatched. Native output
acceptance does not prove physical rendering; diagnostics and vehicle observation remain necessary.

Stop explicitly:

```json
{"type":"navigation.stop","seq":2,"ageMs":0}
```

Errors use `{"type":"error","code":"..."}`. Codes include `guidance_disabled`, `stale_sequence`,
`invalid_message`, `unsupported_message` and `viewer_unavailable`.

## Receive-only video

The user opens **Preview received map** or **Show on cluster**. Cluster projection must already
be ready in DashCast; launching a preview does not activate/change an OEM projection sequence.
The viewer is a separate task and accepts video only. It creates no camera/microphone capture and
requests no capture permission on the vehicle. All capture occurs on the companion device.

When a capable visible viewer becomes available the sender receives `{"type":"video.ready"}`.
When it closes, `{"type":"video.closed"}`. Wait for `video.ready` and offer a **single video track**;
audio and data-channel media sections are rejected. Use a new negotiation ID (1–64 ASCII letters,
digits, underscores or hyphens) on every attempt:

```json
{"type":"video.offer","negotiation":"attempt_1","sdp":"<RTC offer SDP>"}
```

Reply:

```json
{"type":"video.answer","negotiation":"attempt_1","sdp":"<RTC answer SDP>"}
```

Trickle ICE in either direction:

```json
{"type":"video.ice","negotiation":"attempt_1","candidate":"candidate:...","sdpMid":"0","sdpMLineIndex":0}
```

Queue ICE until the corresponding remote description is applied. Candidates are bounded to 128
per negotiation, candidate length 2048, media index 0–8. SDP is bounded to 60,000 UTF-16 units and
the whole message must also meet the UTF-8 limit. The receiver has no STUN/TURN servers; the
companion must likewise use local host candidates and an empty ICE server list. Media uses WebRTC
DTLS-SRTP directly between LAN peers, separate from the ordered control socket. Prefer H.264 if
both endpoints negotiate it; do not assume every vehicle WebView offers a hardware decoder.

```json
{"type":"video.stop","negotiation":"attempt_1"}
```

Viewer errors use `{"type":"video.error","negotiation":"attempt_1","code":"..."}` (for example
`negotiation_failed`, `connection_lost`, `video_timeout`, `playback_failed`, `signalling_overflow`).
After an error/stop use a new negotiation ID. Waiting viewers can accept a new offer without
reopening the Activity. An external reset discards queued old-session signalling. A hidden/closed
viewer releases its connection; a stopped video source clears the displayed image after six
seconds without decoder progress. Keep screen-capture frames flowing even when the map is static.

No remote touch/key injection, audio forwarding, cloud relay, automatic arbitrary-app background
capture or ABRP-specific integration is promised by v1. Application capture and protected-screen
restrictions depend on the companion Android version and app. WebView absence/incompatibility
causes a controlled viewer failure while local navigation and projection remain available.

## Receiver status in DashCast

The Satellite settings page displays connection and guidance separately, using the
receiver's actual callbacks and the serial guidance writer. A disabled receiver is
grey; startup remains grey until the listener is bound. A bound listener is orange
and waiting, successful WSS authentication is green and connected, and a receiver
startup failure is red and unavailable. An open unauthenticated socket or a saved
pairing profile never establishes the connected state.

Guidance is disabled when satellite input is not selected, waiting when no usable
instruction has been processed, active after a validated fresh instruction passes
the current session/source-revision guard, and expired at the existing six-second
deadline including source age. Active input does not assert successful OEM delivery
or physical rendering. Invalid/replayed messages and discarded queued frames do
not renew availability. Source changes, stops, disconnections and token revocation
discard the previous input state; obsolete transport callbacks are fenced.

Each indicator includes a themed icon and a translated accessible label in all 13
app languages. Its snapshot contains only state enums, without credentials, pairing
codes, notification content, road names or peer identifiers. The page samples current
state every 500 milliseconds only while visible and reads it immediately on entry
and return; leaving the page does not stop the receiver or change protocol behavior.

## Compatibility and validation

`navigation-fixtures.json` contains portable accepted/rejected messages and is exercised by the
receiver tests. Copy/pin these fixtures and this contract in the satellite repository; changing
them requires passing both applications' compatibility tests. Additive optional fields can remain
v1; changed meanings/required fields need a new version. Keep historical protocol tests.

Run receiver checks with:

```sh
rtk proxy ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintRelease :app:assembleDebug
rtk proxy node --test tools/satellite/test_receiver.mjs
```

Vehicle gates: disabled receiver preserves local behavior; pairing and revocation work; remote
guidance respects HUD-only/cluster-only/both/off; listener teardown does not clear satellite
guidance; disconnect clears; stale socket cleanup cannot clear a replacement; ignition restart
restores the opted-in receiver; video preview/project/stop release the decoder; test video
resolution/frame rate and latency with Overdrive recording throughout. No measured latency or
vehicle support claim follows from JVM/JavaScript tests.
